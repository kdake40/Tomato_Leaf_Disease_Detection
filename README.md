# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection Using CNN 🌿

This project aims to detect and classify tomato leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of tomato leaf images to identify common diseases such as bacterial spot, early blight, and late blight etc. This can help farmers take preventive measures to protect their crops.
